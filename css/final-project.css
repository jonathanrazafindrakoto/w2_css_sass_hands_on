Create a professional SASS architecture by building these files:

ABSTRACTS (Foundation - no CSS output):
├── _variables.scss    - Colors, fonts, spacing, breakpoints
├── _functions.scss    - Custom functions for calculations
└── _mixins.scss      - Reusable mixins for buttons, cards, etc.

BASE (Global styles):
├── _reset.scss       - CSS reset/normalize
└── _typography.scss  - Font styles, headings, body text

LAYOUT (Major sections):
├── _grid.scss        - Container and grid system
├── _header.scss      - Navigation and header
└── _footer.scss      - Footer styles

COMPONENTS (Reusable UI):
├── _buttons.scss     - All button variations
├── _cards.scss       - Exhibit cards, vendor cards, ticket cards
└── _forms.scss       - Newsletter form, inputs

PAGES (Page-specific):
└── _home.scss        - Hero section, exhibits, vendors, schedule

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
✅ Variables for consistent design tokens
✅ Mixins for reusable button and card styles
✅ Functions for responsive calculations
✅ @for loops for utility classes and grid system
✅ @each loops for theme variations (card types)
✅ @if/@else for conditional styling (card badges)
✅ Built-in functions (color.adjust, mix)
✅ Proper nesting that mirrors HTML structure
✅ Responsive design with mobile-first approach
✅ Well-organized partials for maintainability

BONUS CHALLENGES:
🌟 Create a color theme system using maps
🌟 Generate utility classes with loops
🌟 Build a responsive grid system
🌟 Use advanced mixins with @content blocks
🌟 Implement smooth animations and transitions
🌟 Create hover effects with color functions

Remember: This should demonstrate PROFESSIONAL SASS organization!
